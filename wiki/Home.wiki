#summary Basic overview of PitchLab

= Introduction =

There have been three major additions to the PitchLab application during the course 
of this project. Firstly, PitchLab and its source code are now accessible via Google Code. 
Secondly, all the source code has been documented in accordance to Javadoc standards. This 
documentation is also available [http://pitch-lab.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html here].
Thirdly, 8 instruments have been added in addition to the default Sine sound used during tests.
More importantly, however, PitchLab has been integrated with jMusic, allowing additional instruments 
to be developed and/or added to PitchLab with little code manipulation.
Instructions for this can be found here [https://code.google.com/p/pitch-lab/wiki/Instruments Adding Instruments]
