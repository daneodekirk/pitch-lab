#How to add additional instruments to PitchLab via the jMusic library

= Introduction =

This will act as a guide for anyone who wants to put additional instruments into PitchLab 
for testing purposes.


= Files =

There are 2 files that will need to be edited in order to add an instrument:
  * Constants.java
  * Instruments.java

= Constants.java = 

The Constants.java file is located in the following location:

{{{
pitchLab.reference.Constants
}}}

and behaves as a class that shared global variabled within the PitchLab application.

There is a global variable within this class that governs the Strings that will appear in the dropdown 
menu in PitchLab's main application window.

{{{
36    public static final String[] AVAILABLE_INSTRUMENTS = {
37          "Sine", "Piano", "Harpsicord", "Organ", "Oboe", "Flute", "Clarinet", "Guitar", "Strings"
38    };
}}}
